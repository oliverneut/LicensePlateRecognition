# LicensePlateRecognition
License plate recognition made with OpenCV


# How to run
Run the main.py file with a video of your choice as input. The video must contain a series of videos from cars and their licenseplates must be visible.
The program will then return a .csv file containing the license plates and the frame number in which it has been detected.
